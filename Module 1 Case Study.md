# Case Study Proposal
***Mike Peters***
## Overview and Origin
**PayPal**\
Founded in 1998 Confinity, Later renamed PayPal

Founded by Peter Theil, Max Levchin, and Luke Nosek

The idea for the company came about as an idea palm pilot users to be able to send funds directly from one user to another. After realizing that their customer base would be too small, they changed the method to email users.

They are funded by transaction fees, merchant subscription fees, business loans, cash advances, and referral fees on cash back rewards.

They had a reported gross profit in '22 of $11.653B wgich was a 2.25% decrease their profits in '21 of $11.921B.

## Business Activities
The main goal PayPal set out to solve was making online transactions safer and more secure, as well as giving merchants and consumers and a low cost, easy, and fast alternative to checks at the time.

Because PayPal offers solutions for both consumers and merchants they are both considered customers with the difference being the services they are using.

As of the second quarter of '23 PayPal had 431 million active accounts using their services. thats down 2% from the 435 million they had at the end of '22. In addition to those users PayPal is accepted in over 200 countries and regions around the globe and supports 25 major currencies.

One of the more interesting difference in their services compared to their competitors is the ability for users to purchase a few different crypto currencies (ie. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash) in the native app.

Some of the technology the are using is 128-bit SSL encryption for their transaction security.\
And they used blockchain for the developement of the PYUSD (PayPal USD). which was originally built on the Ethereum-a blockchain.

## Landscape
When the company started they would be solely focused on the payments/billing domain. But in the 25 years since theyve been operating thev have acquired many other companies that has diversified their holding, most recently in the blockchain and crytpocurrency domain.

Some of the major trends and innovations they've adopted in the last few years would include the ability to buy and sell crypto, as well as the development of PYUSD. And offering users the ability to use direct deposit to their PayPal balance.

Some other major companies in this domain would include Apple Pay, Stripe, and Shopify.

## Results
I believe a large impact PayPal has had would be users having a safe and easy way making transactions online, in addition to the ability to get a refund if the purchase was faulty (ie. recieving a product that was not what you bought).

A few of the metrics used in the domain would be TPV (total payment volume), number of active accounts, and payment transactions per active account.

For TPV in '22 PayPal generated 1.36 trillion dollars thats up from the 1.25 trillion in '21.

Compare that to stripes TPV of over $640 billion in '21.

As for the number of users on PayPal at 431 million and 29 million merchant accounts, stripe only has 2 million customers and 3.1 million websites.

As for the transactions per account that number has grown year over year from 31 in '16 to 53 so far in '23.

PayPal stands tall owning over 40% of the payment service market share globally.

## Reccomendations
With all the company acquisitions they seem to be involved in many aspects of the  financial sector. That being said my largest suggestion would be to work on acquiring or partnering with a company to give users the ability to invest in the market either through single stocks or mutual funds.

I think with the development of online wealth management services, and robo-advisors the users PayPal has already would readily use their service to transfer funds into an investment account. 

Roboadvisors to manage their users portfolio, data analytics to give their users the ability to see trends in the market.

I beleive it would be more expidient for PayPal make use of robo-advisors for starting a wealth management division, simply for the fact that they wouldn't have to hire dedicated financial advisors. They could flex the developers they have to beta test the project before going live with a new service.
